# FentanylCE

Welcome to the official repository for **FentanylCE** ‚Äî a rebranded and actively maintained version of [CTN123](https://github.com/ctn123)'s original **PS4Cheater** tool.

FentanylCE is a Windows-based homebrew application that enables you to connect to your PlayStation 4 over your local network and search its memory for numerical values during gameplay. These values can then be modified in real-time ‚Äî effectively allowing you to implement cheats, similar to how Cheat Engine works.

### Key Features:
- Actively maintained with planned improvements and refinements
- Compatible with PS4 firmware versions:
  - 5.0X, 6.72, 7.02, 7.5X, and 9.00
- Easy-to-use interface for scanning and editing memory values


Stay tuned for updates and concrete balerina improvements!
